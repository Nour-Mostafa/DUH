      <p> is the celestial body that orbits the planet
        Earth, and is the largest natural satellite of the Earth and the closest
        celestial body to it. Here is some basic information about the Moon:</p>

    <br>
      <p><i><b> Diameter:</b></i> The diameter of the Moon is about 3,474 kilometers, which is about a quarter of the diameter of the Earth.</p>
     <p><i><b> Mass:</b></i> The Moon is composed mainly of metallic rocks, and does not have a dense atmosphere like the Earth.</p>
     <p><i><b> Surface:</b></i> The surface is full of craters and terrain resulting from the impacts of meteorites and asteroids.
       It also contains plains of volcanic "bricks" called "lowlands" (maria).

      <h1> 2. Rotation and orbit: </h1>
      <br>
      <p><i><b> Orbit:</b></i> The Moon orbits the Earth in an elliptical orbit, and takes about 27.3 days to complete one revolution.</p>
       <p><i><b>Rotation:</b></i> The Moon rotates on its axis at the same speed as it orbits the Earth, which means that it always 
        shows the same face to the Earth. This phenomenon is known as "orbital synchronization."

    <p>The Moon does not produce its own light, but rather reflects the light of the Sun.  The moon appears 
      in different phases due to its position relative to the Earth and the Sun. 
      These phases range from crescent to full moon.</p>

        Since then, many space missions have been sent to the moon by various countries, 
        providing scientists with a lot of information about the composition of the moon and the history of its formation.

       <h1> 1. Moon composition: </h1>
     
       <h1><small><b> Inner layers: </b></small></h1>
       <p><i><b> Core:</b></i> Scientists believe that the lunar core is relatively small compared to the size of the moon,
          and evidence indicates that it may contain iron materials, but in a much smaller proportion than the Earth's core.</p>
        <p><i><b> Mantle:</b></i> This is the layer that occupies the largest part of the moon, and is composed of silicate
          rocks containing minerals such as olivine and basalt.</p>
        <p><i><b> Crust:</b></i> The lunar crust is mainly composed of silicate rocks,
          and is thick in some areas and thinner in others. The average thickness of the lunar crust is about 60 kilometers.</p>

         <h1> 2. Geographical and <br>Environmental Influences: </h1>
         <br>
         <p><i><b> Tides:</b></i> The Moon's gravity is a major cause of ocean tides. When the Moon passes close to the Earth,
          it pulls water towards it, causing tides. Tides occur daily and affect marine life and navigation.</p>
          <p><i><b> Stabilizing the Earth's Tilt:</b></i> The Moon's influence on the Earth helps stabilize the
            tilt of the Earth's axis. Without the Moon, the tilt of the Earth's axis would change significantly,
            which would affect the climate on Earth.</p>

         <p><i><b>The moon has great significance in many cultures and mythologies around the world.</b></i></p>
         <p><i> In ancient civilizations <b><u>such as</b></u> the Egyptians and Babylonians, the moon was worshiped and 
          considered a symbol of heavenly powers.</i></p>
          <p><i> In Greek mythology, the moon was associated with the goddess "Selene" or "Artemis", <b><u>while</u></b> in Chinese culture, 
            the moon is considered a symbol of beauty and grace.</i></p>

       <br>
       <p><i><b> The Apollo Program:</b></i> The American Apollo Program, which ran from 1961 to 1972, was the program 
         that resulted in the first human landing on the moon. During the Apollo 11 mission, Neil Armstrong 
         and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon on July 20, 1969. This was the first time a human had set foot on the moon.</p>
       <p><i><b> Landing on the Moon:</b></i> After Apollo 11, several other missions were conducted, including Apollo
          12, 14, 15, 16 and 17, which brought back samples from the moon's surface and conducted scientific experiments.</p>
       <p><i><b> Recent Explorations:</b></i> In recent years, China, India and the European Union have carried out several
          missions to explore the moon. China, for example, has launched missions such as "Chang'e", which
           successfully landed spacecraft on the moon and brought back samples from its surface. </p>

  <p><i><b> Lunar eclipse:</b></i> A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth is between the sun and the moon, 
    so the Earth's shadow blocks the sunlight from the moon, and the moon appears dark or red (as in a blood moon eclipse).</p> 
  <p><i><b> Solar eclipse:</b></i> A solar eclipse occurs when the moon is between the Earth and the sun,
